  <h1>üé¨ Career</h1>
  <p>
    Nithin Reddy, popularly known as Nithiin, began his acting career in Telugu cinema in 2002. His debut film <strong>Jayam</strong>, directed by Teja, became an instant blockbuster, establishing him as a promising young actor. His charming screen presence and natural acting gained him critical and public appreciation right from the start.
  </p>

  <h2>üîÅ Struggles and Fluctuating Success (2003‚Äì2011)</h2>
  <p>
    After the success of Jayam, Nithiin acted in several films such as <strong>Dil</strong> (2003), <strong>Sye</strong> (2004), and <strong>Allari Bullodu</strong> (2005). While some were moderate successes, many of his films during this period did not perform well at the box office. Despite these setbacks, he remained a fan-favorite for his youthful roles and positive attitude.
  </p>

  <h2>üåü Comeback Era (2012‚Äì2016)</h2>
  <p>
    His major comeback came with the 2012 film <strong>Ishq</strong>, co-starring Nithya Menen and directed by Vikram Kumar. The film was a critical and commercial success and marked a turning point in his career.
  </p>
  <p>
    He followed it up with the hit romantic comedy <strong>Gunde Jaari Gallanthayyinde</strong> (2013), further strengthening his image as a romantic hero. Films like <strong>Heart Attack</strong> (2014) and <strong>Chinnadana Nee Kosam</strong> (2014) kept his popularity intact.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2016, he starred in the blockbuster film <strong>A Aa</strong>, directed by Trivikram Srinivas and co-starring Samantha Ruth Prabhu. This film was a huge commercial success and became one of the top-grossing Telugu films of that year.
  </p>

  <h2>üé≠ Experimentation and Mixed Results (2017‚Äì2021)</h2>
  <p>
    During this phase, Nithiin experimented with different genres. In <strong>LIE</strong> (2017), he played a spy in a suspense thriller. While the film received praise for its ambition, it didn‚Äôt perform well commercially.

  <p>
    In 2020, he starred in <strong>Bheeshma</strong>, a romantic comedy with Rashmika Mandanna. The film was a hit and gave his fans a much-needed treat.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2021, he took on a more serious role in <strong>Check</strong>, playing a chess player imprisoned on terrorism charges. Though unique in concept, the movie received mixed reviews. That same year, he starred in <strong>Maestro</strong>, the Telugu remake of the Bollywood film <em>Andhadhun</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>üìâ Recent Work and Upcoming Projects (2022‚ÄìPresent)</h2>
  <p>
    His 2023 film <strong>Extra Ordinary Man</strong> received mixed-to-negative reviews, and didn‚Äôt perform well commercially. However, he is set to return with an action-entertainer titled <strong>Robinhood</strong>, scheduled for release in 2025.
